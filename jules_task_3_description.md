Create the UI for the booking notes section on the new unified booking details page.

This should be a simple component that displays a list of notes and has a form to add a new note.

The component should be created in a new file: `src/components/booking-notes.tsx`.

For now, the component can use mock data. The integration with the API will be done in a separate task.
