Update the `src/pages/sitter/my-bookings.tsx` page to include two tabs: "Upcoming" and "Past".

The "Upcoming" tab should be the default tab.

For now, the content of both tabs can be the same as the current content of the page. The logic for filtering the bookings will be implemented in a separate task.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling the tabs to match the existing design of the sitter portal.
