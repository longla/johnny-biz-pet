Add a new column to the booking requests table in `src/pages/admin/index.tsx`.

This column will show the number of sitters that have been notified for each booking.

For now, it can be a placeholder value like "0/2" (meaning 0 accepted out of 2 notified). The logic for fetching the actual data will be implemented in a separate task.
