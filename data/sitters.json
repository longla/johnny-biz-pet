      "Hi, I'm Johnny! I run a boutique-style dog care experience out of my peaceful home, where your pup is treated like family and pampered like they are on vacation. After over 15 years of hands-on experience, including time as a vet assistant, I left the corporate world behind to do what I love full-time: caring for dogs.",
      "Every stay is customized to your dog's personality and needs. Whether they are shy and sensitive or playful and high-energy, I create a calm, nurturing space where they can thrive. I'm home all day, which means your pup gets round-the-clock attention, comfort, and companionship. No crowded kennels, no rushed potty breaks, just a safe, cozy retreat designed for relaxation and joy.",
      "And yes, I go the extra mile. From enrichment walks and cuddle time to optional extras like PAW-casso paintings and storytime, I make sure each dog feels safe, engaged, and loved while you're away. My place is kept sparkling clean, and I send tons of updates so you'll always know your pup is happy and in good hands."
