I messaged multiple people and met a few sitters- and I found Johnny who literally couldn't have been a more perfect fit. He was quick to respond, asked really good questions, and met up with us for a meet and greet to ensure he was also comfortable with our pug and that she was comfortable with him. He reassured me throughout my first rover booking process (and first time leaving her with someone who wasn't family in 10 years) that she would be fine and that he would send updates frequently. Johnny sent multiple pictures, videos and updates throughout the day. He is honest, forward and I feel fully confident that he is doing this work because he has a heart of gold and loves dogs. My dog is a senior pug and she is fully blind and diabetic, he made sure that my dog had a space that was safe so she wouldn't run into everything- and he familiarized her with the space. He gave insulin injections to her on time, took her on frequent walks, and gave her extra cuddles and love. It was a wonderful experience and as first time boarders, I am thoroughly pleased with the services Johnny gave. Although we are highly anxious pup parents, he comforted us and gave us courage to book our next trip with the care he provided. I highly recommend and I'm sure my words don't suffice- Johnny, thank you for taking care of our baby!",

I was nervous about leaving them with someone new but he was so great about sending daily updates including pictures & videos. Johnny went out of his way to walk them multiple times a day and even took them to the park! My pups had a great time and I'm so happy we found a trustful, local sitter. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Johnny was seriously the best dog sitter ever. Me and my friend are travel nurses in the area and were sort of scrambling for a last minute dog sitter, and we were so lucky to find him. He actually drove out of his way to meet us at our place just to see the pups and show us how they react with him. They were drawn to him right away. We work long shifts and he was able to pick the dogs up in the morning and we picked them up after our shift. He sent at least 15 videos and pictures and you could tell the dogs were incredibly well taken care of. They went to the park multiple times and multiple walks. He kept the dogs on their food schedule and just really went above and beyond. Not to mention it was three dogs, that all sort of have their own needs in which he was able to accommodate with gratitude. Meeting Johnny is sort of like meeting a friend that you have know for years, so don't hesitate to trust him with your pet children!",

He went out of his way to come meet Bandit(pup) and I beforehand to become acquainted before their time together. With his experience and just all around good vibe, I felt very comfortable with going back East for the holidays. Johnny updated me daily, sometimes twice, with updates/check ins. I ended up having to extend the time and he was totally open, flexible and understanding. Pretty much consider him Bandit's uncle now. I will definitely be asking Johnny to watch Bandit again. 10/10 recommend having Johnny pet sit :)",
